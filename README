DrawingTool provides drawing tools specified as follows:

C w h           Create Canvas: Should create a new canvas of width w and height h.

L x1 y1 x2 y2   Create Line: Should create a new line from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2). Currently only horizontal or vertical lines are supported. Horizontal and vertical lines will be drawn using the 'x' character.

R x1 y1 x2 y2   Create Rectangle: Should create a new rectangle, whose upper left corner is (x1,y1) and lower right corner is (x2,y2). Horizontal and vertical lines will be drawn using the 'x' character.

B x y c         Bucket Fill: Should fill the entire area connected to (x,y) with "colour" c. The behaviour of this is the same as that of the "bucket fill" tool in paint programs.

In order to run DrawingTool, run the following on the command line: python DrawingTool.py <path to input file> <path to output file>

For example, python DrawingTool.py input/input.txt output/output.txt

In order to run DrawingTool's tests, run the following on the command line: python testDrawingTool.py <path to input file>
Note: an output file is not necessary for the tests

This will invoke all tests, print board state for each test, and indicate whether or not all tests passed.
